"Proxy Order Platform"
A simple platform that lets users submit product links from sites like AliExpress, Amazon, SHEIN, Temu, and place an order through a local proxy service. This is not a typical e-commerce store â€” it helps users who cannot shop internationally.

People without international payment methods
Customers wanting easier customs & delivery
Users preferring a single local payment option

How It Works:

User adds items to cart & checks out
Admin receives order, buys product, and delivers locally

Features:
Link submission & price input
Price calculator (Base + Commission + Delivery)
Cart & checkout form

Admin access dashboard
